## Project Title
Time Capsule

### Description
An app designed to provide a time capsule for users to store away media for a set amount of time and then view it later to reflect on their memories. The user is given the option to upload media using their camera or through their photo library. The image is then locked away behind a blur effect for a set amount of time based on which view controller the user chooses (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month). When the set time has passed the user is notified and the image is available for viewing. A new image is then uploaded and blurred.
